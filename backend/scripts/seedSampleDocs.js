WELD PARAMETER OPTIMIZATION: ULTRASONIC CELL WELDING

STATUS: APPROVED
CHANGE TYPE: Process Parameter Modification
RISK LEVEL: Medium
EFFECTIVE DATE: April 15, 2024

1. CHANGE DESCRIPTION
Modification of ultrasonic welding parameters at battery cell tab welding stations (W1-W4) to improve weld strength consistency and reduce scrap rate.

2. CURRENT STATE
- Weld energy: 450J ± 20J
- Weld time: 0.35 seconds
- Amplitude: 35 microns
- Force: 200N
- Current scrap rate: 2.3% (target: < 1.5%)
- Current Cpk: 1.15

3. PROPOSED STATE
- Weld energy: 480J ± 15J (increased energy, tighter tolerance)
- Weld time: 0.32 seconds (reduced)
- Amplitude: 38 microns (increased)
- Force: 220N (increased)
- Expected scrap rate: < 0.8%
- Expected Cpk: > 1.67

4. JUSTIFICATION
4.1 Problem Statement
Current weld parameters produce acceptable but inconsistent results. Process capability (Cpk 1.15) is below the 1.33 target. Approximately 2.3% of welds require rework, impacting cycle time and cost.

4.2 Root Cause Analysis
- Energy level at lower bound creates marginal welds during material lot variations
- Longer weld time increases heat input, causing occasional thermal damage
- Current force is insufficient for consistent coupling during high-speed operation

4.3 Expected Benefits
- 65% reduction in scrap rate (2.3% to 0.8%)
- Improved process capability (Cpk 1.15 to 1.67)
- Annual cost savings: estimated $340,000
- Reduced rework time: 15 minutes/shift average

5. VALIDATION PLAN
5.1 Pre-Production Validation
- DOE (Design of Experiments): 32 runs with 4 factors, 2 levels
- Pull test validation: 200 samples at new parameters
- Cross-section analysis: 20 samples for penetration depth verification
- Thermal analysis: IR camera monitoring during welding

5.2 Production Validation
- 500-unit pilot run on Station W1
- 100% pull test for first 100 units
- Statistical process control monitoring for full pilot run
- Compare results against current production baseline

6. RISK ASSESSMENT
Risk: Increased force may accelerate sonotrode wear
Mitigation: Reduce sonotrode replacement interval from 50,000 to 40,000 welds

- Faster cure time increases throughput by 2 JPH at body shop bottleneck

5. VALIDATION RESULTS
- Full vehicle crash test: PASS (NHTSA 5-star equivalent)
- 1000-hour salt spray corrosion test: PASS
- Thermal cycling (-40°C to +80°C, 500 cycles): PASS
- Production trial (500 vehicles): Zero adhesive-related defects

6. IMPLEMENTATION
- Week 1: Install new dispensing equipment and purge lines

AUTOMATED VISION INSPECTION: WIRE HARNESS ROUTING

STATUS: APPROVED
CHANGE TYPE: Inspection Method
RISK LEVEL: Low
EFFECTIVE DATE: April 1, 2024

1. CHANGE DESCRIPTION
Replace manual visual inspection of wire harness routing at GA Stations 6-7 with automated camera-based inspection system. The system uses AI-powered image recognition to verify harness routing, connector seating, and clip installation.

2. CURRENT STATE
- Inspection method: Manual visual by operator (self-inspect)
- Inspection time: 15 seconds per vehicle
- Detection rate: ~88% (based on downstream escape data)
- Common escapes: Missing clips, loose connectors, incorrect routing

3. PROPOSED STATE
- Inspection method: 8-camera vision system with AI analysis
- Inspection time: 3 seconds per vehicle (automated)
- Expected detection rate: >99%
- System: Cognex ViDi Deep Learning platform
- Training dataset: 10,000 labeled images (correct and defective)

4. JUSTIFICATION
- 12% of warranty claims in harness category traced to routing defects
- Manual inspection inconsistent across operators and shifts
- Camera system provides 100% documented evidence per vehicle
- Expected warranty cost reduction: $280K/year
- ROI payback period: 8 months

5. SYSTEM SPECIFICATIONS
- 8x Cognex IS7800 cameras (5MP resolution)
- LED ring lighting with polarization filters
- Processing time: < 2 seconds for full analysis
- Pass/fail decision with defect location overlay
- Image archive: 90 days rolling storage

6. FAILURE MODE HANDLING
- If vision system detects defect: Yellow light, operator corrects and re-scans
- If vision system is offline: Revert to manual inspection protocol
- If uncertain result (confidence < 95%): Flag for manual verification
- Daily system calibration check using reference panel

PACKAGING METHOD CHANGE: BATTERY MODULE SHIPPING

STATUS: PENDING VALIDATION
CHANGE TYPE: Packaging and Logistics
RISK LEVEL: Medium
TARGET EFFECTIVE DATE: June 1, 2024

1. CHANGE DESCRIPTION
Transition battery module shipping packaging from single-use cardboard/foam to reusable plastic totes with custom foam inserts. This change applies to all battery modules shipped between Cell Manufacturing and Pack Assembly buildings.

2. CURRENT STATE
- Packaging: Corrugated cardboard box with EPS foam inserts
- Modules per container: 2
- Container lifecycle: Single use (recycled after unpacking)
- Damage rate during transport: 0.8%
- Annual packaging cost: $1.2M
- Annual packaging waste: 45 tons

3. PROPOSED STATE
- Packaging: HDPE returnable tote (Part# RT-BM-400)
- Modules per container: 4 (double current capacity)
- Container lifecycle: 250+ cycles (5-year estimated life)
- Expected damage rate: < 0.1%
- Annual packaging cost: $180K (after Year 1 investment)
- Annual packaging waste: < 2 tons (end-of-life recycling only)

4. JUSTIFICATION
- 85% reduction in packaging cost after Year 1
- 96% reduction in packaging waste
- Better protection reduces module damage during transport
- Doubles shipping density (fewer forklift trips required)
- Aligns with Tesla sustainability commitments

5. RISK ASSESSMENT
Risk: Tote damage or contamination affecting module quality
Mitigation: Automated tote wash and inspection station at return point

Risk: Insufficient tote inventory during ramp-up
Mitigation: Order 120% of calculated requirement, phase out cardboard gradually

Risk: Foam insert degradation over time
Mitigation: Replace inserts every 50 cycles, visual inspection at wash station

6. VALIDATION PLAN
- Ship vibration test: ISTA 3A protocol with loaded totes
- Drop test: Corner and edge drops from 0.5m height
- 30-day pilot: Track damage rate on 500 module shipments
- Cost tracking: Compare actual vs projected savings for 90 days

APPROVAL STATUS
Manufacturing Engineering: APPROVED
Quality Engineering: APPROVED
Logistics: APPROVED
Finance: PENDING (reviewing Year 1 investment)
Sustainability: APPROVED
